Your goal is to learn the material on neural computation, not get bogged down in implementation details that depend on the programming language, and it'd be super lame if those problems prevented you from learning as much as you could in this course!"

    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is, as of August 2016, one of the top five most popular programming languages according to the [TIOBE Index](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/). Of the five most popular languages, it is universally acclaimed as the easiest to use, as it operates at a higher level of abstraction than the other top contenders. This has lead to Python becoming the language of choice for teaching introductory computer science ([data as of 2014](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext)) and the second-most popular language for data science ([data as of 2015](http://thenextweb.com/dd/2016/04/08/start-using-python-andor-r-data-science-one-best/#gref)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python emphasizes the human side of coding: it is considered more important in Python for a human programmer to be able to easily and quickly understand what a piece of code does and why than it is for that code to run quickly when implemented by a machine. This is especially important in an educational setting where understanding is paramount and speed is secondary."

    "### Why Not MATLAB?\n",
    "\n",
    "[This blog post](http://bastibe.de/2013-01-20-a-python-primer-for-matlab-users.html) introduces MATLAB users to Python and states two reasons not to use MATLAB:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python is free and MATLAB is not.\n",
    "1. Python is a general-purpose programming language and MATLAB is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me expand on those two points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The fact that Python is free means that there is a larger community contributing software that you can use (like Jupyter Notebooks, which are developed at Berkeley!) and which determines the direction of the language in a relatively democratic and open manner. It also means that your code is more portable. \n",
    "1. MATLAB is an almost-unbeatably efficient matrix-manipulation scripting language. It struggles, however, to deal with any data structure that isn't \"like\" a matrix. This includes strings, data frames, and even functions. This means that Python can be used in a whole variety of situations in which MATLAB isn't a great choice: building graphical user interfaces, providing web services, processing text corpora, scraping data from the web, and so on."

    "### Why Python 3?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some people may be coming in using Python 2.7, even though the current (as of August 19, 2016) release version of Python is 3.5. This is due to the non-backwards-compatibility of Python 3, which meant that many scientific computing libraries were slow to update. As recently as two years ago, there were still many packages that were only available in 2.7, but there has been a sea change, and almost all packages are 3-compatible, and soon some of them will only support Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "A notable benefit of using a general-purpose open-source language like Python is that you won't be forced to uninstall any version of Python that you currently have. Many of you probably have the [Anaconda distribution](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) of Python, and so have a built-in system for managing multiple Python versions. We'll be using virtual environments, which achieve the same thing but are more lightweight.\n",
    "\n",
    "One big benefit of Python 3.5 for this course is something that appears quite small: matrix/vector multiplication in Python now has its own operator: `@`. In past versions of Python, taking a dot product involved using the function `np.dot`. This may seem small, but it means that instead of having to write and read expressions like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    dw = np.dot((dataset-np.dot(weights,output)),output.T)\n",
    "```\n",
    "you'll find:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    dw = (dataset - weights @ output) @ output.T\n",
    "```\n",
    "which looks a lot more like the math:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\Delta w = (D - W \\cdot O) \\cdot O^{T}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and is hopefully easier to read (or at least, it will be a few weeks into the course!)."
